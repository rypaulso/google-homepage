Copying the google homepage for my first real assignment. Should be fun?

Update:

Finished making a clone of the Google front page. Took longer than expected, but I also tried to line up everything pixel perfect... probably shouldn't have done that due to the stress. But, I am proud of what I've made. Hopefully I can come back in the future and look at the code and laugh at how easy it should've been.
